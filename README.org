* Emacs Config 2.0

Better than the [[https://github.com/chhajedji/.emacs.d/tree/1.0][original 1.0]] in some aspects. 1.0 was a monopoly of
[[https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLX2044Ew-UVVv31a0-Qn3dA6Sd_-NyA1n][Uncle Dave's tutorials]]. 2.0 uses the power from the vast internet and
configuration knowledge is not restricted by some Uncle Dave.

Here we go with the config...

Firstly Install [[https://melpa.org/#/][MELPA]], which is a better package maanger for
Emacs. Better in a way that it offers tons of more packages and to be
honest, [[https://elpa.gnu.org/][ELPA]], the default ones are not even useful. To install MELPA, add
following snippet at the starting of your [[./init.el][init.el]].

#+begin_emacs-lisp
(require 'package)
;; Any add to list for package-archives (to add marmalade or melpa) goes here
(add-to-list 'package-archives 
    '("MELPA" .
      "http://melpa.org/packages/"))
(package-initialize)
#+end_emacs-lisp
